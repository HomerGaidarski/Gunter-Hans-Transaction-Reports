To send monthly gunter hans report emails,
do the following in the console of your server:

First open a new crontab:

crontab -e

Next add the following lines to the bottom of the crontab:

0 0 1 * * python /home/azureuser/gunterhansMonthly/sendReport.py
@reboot python /home/azureuser/gunterhansMonthly/sendReport.py


Your file path may vary depending on where you placed the gunterhansMonthly folder
(the same folder this text file should be in), so edit the file path appropriately for
both lines before saving.
